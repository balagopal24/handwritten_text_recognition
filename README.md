# Handwritten classification
In this repository i have made a research, collect researches, 
learned how algorithms running and made examples.

- In Simple_pytorch folder, i have made a very simple real handwritten digit classification.
I really drew a number on paper, photographed and classified the drawing number.
- Other two folders are just collection of my studies.
